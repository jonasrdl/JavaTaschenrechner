## Special thanks to [Drumna](https://github.com/Drumna) he helped me a lot with this project.

Just download the file [here](https://github.com/jonasrdl/JavaTaschenrechner/releases) and (possibly navigate to the correct directory e.g. `cd ~/Downloads`).

Then run `java -jar JavaTaschenrechner.jar` in your Terminal. Have fun :)
